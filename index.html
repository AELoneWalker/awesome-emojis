            <h3>ðŸ¤£ Rolling on the Floor Laughing</h3>
            <p>A yellow face with a big grin and scrunched,
                X-shaped eyes, tilted on its side as if rolling <br> on the floor laughing (the internet acronym ROFL).
                Sheds two tears and tilts right on most platforms.<br> Often conveys hysterical 
               laughter more intense than ðŸ˜‚ Face With Tears of Joy.</p>
                                              <br><br>
               <h3>ðŸ˜‰ Winking Face</h3>
               <p>A yellow face with a slight smile shown winking,
                usually its left eye. May signal a joke,<br> flirtation, hidden meaning, or general positivity.
                Tone varies, including playful, affectionate, suggestive, or ironic.</p>
                   <br><br>
                <h3>ðŸ˜† Grinning Squinting Face</h3>
                <p>A yellow face with a broad, open smile and scrunched,<br>
                    X-shaped eyes. Often conveys excitement or hearty laughter.</p>
                       <br><br>
                <h3>ðŸ¤‘ Money-Mouth Face</h3>
                <p>A yellow face with raised eyebrows, dollar signs for eyes,
                and an open smile sticking out<br> a tongue styled after a green, dollar banknote.
                Some platforms depict the dollar-sign eyes in green circles.</p>
                        <br><br>
                <h3>ðŸ¤ª Zany Face</h3>
                <p>A smiley making a silly face. A yellow face with a big grin and wide,
                white eyes,<br> one larger than the other and in a wild, cockeyed expression.
                Many platforms, including Apple,<br> depict its tongue stuck out and head tilted;
                others feature a full-toothed grin, giving it a more unhinged appearance.</p>
